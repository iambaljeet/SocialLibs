**SocialLibs** A growing set of libraries helping developers develop social media tools with ease.

# Libraries
- InstaTools: A library with some handy tools like downlaoding posts (Image/Video) or DP of any public profile.
- TextRepeater: A library with options to input a text and gets a repeated text with whatever limit is given. Also, this library saves the history of all repeated messages.
- WhatsappTools: A library using which one can send message to any whatsapp contact without saving there number.

# Plans
I will keep expanding and updating the tools as and when required. Current functionalities are limited but will be expanded with future releases and with response of the users.
If you wanted to use any of these libraries. It would be appreciated if you can add a link to this project in about section of your app.
